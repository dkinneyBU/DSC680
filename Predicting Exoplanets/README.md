## Predicting Exoplanets

### Introduction  

The **NASA Exoplanet Archive** is an online astronomical exoplanet and stellar catalog and data service that collates and cross-correlates astronomical data and information on exoplanets and their host stars. These data include stellar parameters (such as positions, magnitudes, and temperatures), exoplanet parameters (such as masses and orbital parameters) and discovery/characterization data (such as published radial velocity curves, photometric light curves, images, and spectra). [1]

### Data  

The dataset I am leveraging is the **Kepler Object of Interest (KOI)** table, located on the NASA Exoplanet Archive website noted above. The Data Columns documentation can be reviewed here: Data columns in Kepler Objects of Interest Table (caltech.edu). The dataset can be found here: Kepler Objects of Interest (caltech.edu). The dataset consists of 9,565 rows with 2,358 confirmed exoplanets, 2,366 candidates and 4,840 false positives.

### Methods/Evaluation/Techniques - list of methods for the project (like DT, KNN, etc)

### Conclusion - how the project wrapped up with results

### Navigation - explain how to look at each of the files in the repository
